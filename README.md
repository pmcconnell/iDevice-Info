**iDevice Info** is a universal reference app for iOS design and development.

It keeps handy iOS device information at your fingertips. 

##Installation
Just clone and open the project in Xcode. It was originally developed in Xcode 4 for iOS 6.1. I have no idea how it works on earlier versions of iOS or Xcode 5. It doesn't use any special components so it should work just fine. Try it.

##Updating
When new devices are released it is only a matter of editing the devices.plist file. If a new image is needed you would need to add that as well.

There is a Misc. tab in the iPhone interface that I had envisioned as a place to record notes. This is not implemented and is left blank in this version.

##Issues
I'm sure there are lots of less than optimal stuff in here. This was just a project to scratch an itch. It works. If you find it useful, great! If you make a change or update I would love to hear about it.

##License
You are free to do whatever you like with this. This project is released under the MIT License as that seems to be the most in the spirit of do as you wish. Enjoy.
